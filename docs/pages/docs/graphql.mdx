# Why Migrate from GraphQL?

The **NestJS tRPC** adapter offers a powerful alternative to NestJS & GraphQL. Here's why you might consider migrating:

### Key Advantages

1. **End-to-End Type Safety**
Achieve seamless type inference from backend to frontend without code generation, significantly reducing runtime errors caused by type mismatches.

2. **Simplified Development**
Eliminate the need for schema definitions and resolvers. Directly utilize your existing models and business logic, resulting in less boilerplate and faster development cycles.

3. **Familiar NestJS Patterns**
Leverage your existing NestJS knowledge with minimal learning curve, as `nestjs-trpc` integrates smoothly with the NestJS ecosystem.

4. **Performance Benefits**
Enjoy a lighter-weight solution compared to a full GraphQL implementation, with reduced overhead in request processing and response serialization.

5. **Seamless Integration**
Integrate tRPC alongside your existing NestJS modules and services, enabling a gradual migration path from GraphQL to tRPC.

6. **Enhanced Developer Experience**
Benefit from full IDE support including autocomplete and IntelliSense, easier debugging, and a simplified testing setup compared to GraphQL.

7. **Flexible Querying**
Utilize powerful query composition, including the ability to batch multiple procedure calls in a single HTTP request and support for efficient caching and invalidation strategies.

### Migration Considerations

- Learning Curve: Your team will need to familiarize themselves with tRPC concepts, though they are generally straightforward for TypeScript developers.
- Client-Side Updates: Existing client-side code will require updates to use the tRPC client instead of GraphQL queries.
- Feature Parity: Evaluate whether tRPC can fulfill all your current GraphQL use cases before committing to migration.

<Callout type="warning">
  If your application heavily relies on GraphQL-specific features like subscriptions, carefully assess if tRPC can meet these needs before proceeding with migration.
