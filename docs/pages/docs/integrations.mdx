# Integrations

### Accessing the AppRouter
In some circumstances ,for example end-to-end tests or integrating with other `trpc` plugins, you may want to get a reference to the generated appRouter object. In end-to-end tests, you can then run queries using the appRouter object directly without using any HTTP listeners.

You can access the generated appRouter using the `AppRouterHost` class:

```typescript
const { appRouter } = app.get(AppRouterHost);
```
<Callout>
You must call the `AppRouterHost.appRouter{:tsx}` getter after the application has been initialized (after the `onModuleInit` hook has been triggered by either the `app.listen(){:tsx}` or `app.init(){:tsx}` method).
</Callout>

With the runtime appRouter object, you can integrate with virtually any trpc-specific library, this includes [trpc-panel](https://github.com/iway1/trpc-panel), [trpc-openapi](https://github.com/jlalmes/trpc-openapi), [trpc-playground](https://github.com/sachinraja/trpc-playground) and more.

### Integrating with `trpc-panel`
Here is a short example of how to integrate [trpc-panel](https://github.com/iway1/trpc-panel), while this is a specific integration, the techniques used here can be applied to any of the trpc-specific libraries you wish to include. <br/>
If you still run into issues, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/KevinEdry/nestjs-trpc/issues/new) or contact us via Discord.

<Steps>
  ### Installation
  To install `trpc-panel` with your preferred package manager, you can use any of the following commands:
  <Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      ```bash copy
      npm install trpc-panel
      ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      ```bash copy
      pnpm add trpc-panel
      ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      ```bash copy
      yarn add trpc-panel
      ```
     </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      ```bash copy
      bun install trpc-panel
      ```
     </Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs>

  ### Creating the Panel Controller
  As per the `trpc-panel` [docs](https://github.com/iway1/trpc-panel?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start) we need to serve the panel, using the `renderTrpcPanel` method for every method on route `/panel`.

  ```typescript {8, 14-16} filename="trpc-panel.controller.ts" copy
  import { All, Controller, Inject, OnModuleInit } from '@nestjs/common';
  import { renderTrpcPanel } from 'trpc-panel';
  import { AnyRouter } from '@trpc/server';
  import { AppRouterHost } from 'nestjs-trpc';

  @Controller()
  export class TrpcPanelController implements OnModuleInit {
    private appRouter!: AnyRouter;

    constructor(
      @Inject(AppRouterHost) private readonly appRouterHost: AppRouterHost,
    ) {}

    onModuleInit() {
      this.appRouter = this.appRouterHost.appRouter;
    }

    @All('/panel')
    panel(): string {
      return renderTrpcPanel(this.appRouter, {
        url: 'http://localhost:8080/trpc',
      });
    }
  }
  ```
  <Callout>
    As you can see in the example above, we are using `onModuleInit` lifecycle method to make sure the appRouter is initialized and available.
  </Callout>

  ### Register the Controller
  In order to apply the new Controller routes, we need to register it in the `app.module.ts` file.

  ```typescript /TrpcPanelController/ filename="app.module.ts" copy
  @Module({
    imports: [
      TRPCModule.forRoot({
        autoSchemaFile: './src/@generated',
        context: AppContext,
      }),
    ],
    controllers: [TrpcPanelController],
    providers: [],
  })
  export class AppModule {}
  ```
</Steps>

Once you've registered the controller, start your NestJS application. You can then access the tRPC panel at https://localhost:8080/panel.
