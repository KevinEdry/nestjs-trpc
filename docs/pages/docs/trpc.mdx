# tRPC Core Concepts

### What is tRPC?

[tRPC](https://trpc.io/) is a powerful library for building end-to-end typesafe APIs without the need for a code generator. It allows you to define your APIs using TypeScript, ensuring that your client and server are always in sync.

### Why Choose tRPC?

- **Type Safety**: Ensures end-to-end type safety without the need for code generation.
- **Productivity**: Enhances developer productivity by reducing boilerplate code and runtime errors.
- **Flexibility**: Can be used with any framework, including React, Next.js, and even vanilla TypeScript projects.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead compared to traditional REST or GraphQL.

### Core Concepts

#### Routers and Procedures

tRPC revolves around the concept of routers and procedures. A router can contain multiple procedures, which are either queries or mutations.

- **Router**: A collection of related procedures.
- **Procedure**: A function exposed through the router, which can be a query (read-only operation) or a mutation (write operation).

#### Type Inference

tRPC leverages TypeScript's type inference to ensure that types are consistent across the client and server. When you define a router and its procedures, tRPC automatically infers the types for you.

#### Data Transformation

tRPC allows you to define custom data transformers for serializing and deserializing data, ensuring that your API can handle complex data structures seamlessly.

#### Middlewares

tRPC supports middlewares, allowing you to add custom logic to your procedures. This can include authentication, authorization, logging, etc.

### Example Concepts

#### Defining a Router

Here's how you can define a simple router with a query and a mutation:

```typescript
import { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';

const t = initTRPC.create();

const appRouter = t.router({
  getUser: t.procedure
    .input(z.string())
    .query(({ input }) => {
      return { id: input, name: 'John Doe' };
    }),

  createUser: t.procedure
    .input(z.object({ name: z.string() }))
    .mutation(({ input }) => {
      return { id: '1', ...input };
    }),
});

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;
```

#### Type-Safe Client

With the router defined, tRPC ensures type safety on the client side:

```typescript
import { createTRPCProxyClient, httpLink } from '@trpc/client';
import type { AppRouter } from './path/to/server';

const trpc = createTRPCProxyClient<AppRouter>({
  links: [
    httpLink({
      url: 'http://localhost:3000/trpc',
    }),
  ],
});

async function main() {
  const user = await trpc.getUser.query('1');
  console.log(user); // { id: '1', name: 'John Doe' }

  const newUser = await trpc.createUser.mutation({ name: 'Jane Doe' });
  console.log(newUser); // { id: '1', name: 'Jane Doe' }
}

main();
```
