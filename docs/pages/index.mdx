## Introduction
**NestJS RPC** is a library designed to integrate the capabilities of tRPC into the NestJS framework. It aims to provide native support for decorators and implement an opinionated approach that aligns with NestJS conventions.

## Main Features
- ✅&nbsp; Supports most tRPC features out of the box with more to come.
- 🧙‍&nbsp; Full static typesafety & autocompletion on the client, for inputs, outputs, and errors.
- 🙀&nbsp; Implements the Nestjs opinionated approach to how tRPC works.
- ⚡️&nbsp; Same client-side DX - We generate the AppRouter on the fly.
- 🔋&nbsp; Examples are available in the ./examples folder.
- 📦&nbsp; Out of the box support for **Dependency Injection** within the routes and procedures.
- 👀&nbsp; Native support for `express`, and `zod` with more drivers to come!

## Using the Docs
The **NestJS-tRPC** docs are devided in three main sections:
- Getting Started - This is the entrypoint for every new user of tRPC or NestJS and our adapter. In there you will find basic information about how to use either frameworks, how to install and set up our adapter.
- Usage - This section focuses more on how to use the adapter, its different decorators, and how to navigate through the opinionated approach to create an easily accessible api.

## Who is NestJS tRPC for?
**NestJS tRPC** is for full-stack Typescript developers that already uses NestJS (maybe with GraphQL) and are looking to get a better DX out of their APIs. This adapter makes it easy to write NestJS opinionated endpoints that you can safely use in both your frontend and backend applications.
