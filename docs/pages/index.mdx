## Introduction
**NestJS RPC** is a library designed to integrate the capabilities of tRPC into the NestJS framework. It aims to provide native support for decorators and implement an opinionated approach that aligns with NestJS conventions.

## Features
- ✅&nbsp; Supports most tRPC features out of the box with more to come.
- 🧙‍&nbsp; Full static typesafety & autocompletion on the client, for inputs, outputs, and errors.
- 🙀&nbsp; Implements the Nestjs opinionated approach to how tRPC works.
- ⚡️&nbsp; Same client-side DX - We generate the AppRouter on the fly.
- 🔋&nbsp; Examples are available in the ./examples folder.
- 📦&nbsp; Out of the box support for **Dependency Injection** within the routes and procedures.
- 👀&nbsp; Native support for `express`, and `zod` with more drivers to come!
